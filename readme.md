# Bankaks mobile application

The main challenge for the application was to fetch data from the given API and to provide forms and values corresponding to the API data on each end points. Different content and detail needs to be present on differnt end point.

I used Retrofit which is a REST(Representational State Transfer) Client for Java and android. Also a gson converter to convert object into the json format recognized by api.
